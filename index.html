        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>So all this started back when I was a lil bitty kid and my dad brought home a raspberry pi. I asked him what
            it did and he said "it's for making virtual machines my son". And of course I'm like 11 so I'm goin "The
            heck's a virtual machine???". Now, my father wasn't really one for succinct explainations so I didn't really
            get whatever he explained them to be. All I know is by the time I got my hands on the raspberry pi, I found
            an old ass version of scratch on that thang. It let me make weird lil games outta blocks of code and this
            was pure magic to my 11 year old brain. And that was it. I had been inducted into the dark occult generally
            referred to as 'computer science', and I've been laboring in it's service ever since.</p>

        <p>Of course now I don't speak to computers in block anymore. Now I program things using things like: vague
            mutterings, compilers and the occasional tail of newt.
            Nah I'm just messing with you. I don't actually use any of those things, but sometimes I might was well be.
            These days I be making games in Godot. But sometimes I make a half hearted attempt at learning unity. It's
            been a few years since I released a game. Currently working on a sequel to my flop game "Not A Drill".
